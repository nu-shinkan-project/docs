# Instructions for Writing Documents

## 1. Classify the document before writing

Choose the document type based on its intended audience and use, not its title or file format.

| Type                | Intended use                                                                                               | Examples                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discussion document | Help participants in the current conversation review progress, discuss options, or decide what to do next. | Status summaries, proposed implementation plans, work reports, discussion records.       |
| Reference document  | Help readers understand or perform something without access to the current conversation.                   | Tool and command guides, onboarding materials, design documents, operational procedures. |

- If the document is intended for future readers or serves both purposes, apply the reference-document rules below.
- When editing an existing document, preserve its intended purpose and organize additions accordingly.
- Infer the type from the request and the document. Ask the user only if the intended use is unclear and would materially change the content.
- Discussion documents have no additional requirements under this guide. Other applicable repository instructions still apply.

## 2. Write reference documents for readers without chat context

### Establish the context the reader needs

- Start with the document's subject, purpose, and scope.
- State prerequisites and define unfamiliar terms before using them.
- Include or link the background needed to understand the document. Do not assume the reader has access to the chat.
- Use explicit names for tools, files, components, and decisions. Avoid references such as "the earlier approach" or "as discussed above" when their meaning depends on the conversation.

### Organize by the reader's task or understanding

- Present information from general concepts to specific details, and from prerequisites to dependent steps.
- For a guide, explain what the tool does, what is required, how to use it, and how to recognize success.
- For a design document, explain the problem and constraints, the design, and the reasons for consequential choices.
- Use only the sections needed for the document's purpose; these examples are not mandatory templates.

### Describe the resulting design or procedure

- Present the final agreed design, procedure, or rule directly. Do not organize the document around the order in which the conversation unfolded.
- Keep rationale, constraints, and tradeoffs that help readers understand or use the result. Explain them without requiring knowledge of who proposed or corrected an idea.
- Omit abandoned proposals, intermediate drafts, and conversational corrections unless they are needed to explain a decision or the document explicitly records history.
- If a decision is unresolved, label it as unresolved. Do not present a proposal as an agreed fact.
- When editing, integrate changes into the relevant sections and update conflicting statements rather than appending a conversational addendum.

For example, if the agreed procedure is to run validation before deployment:

- Avoid: "We first planned to deploy immediately, but then agreed to add validation."
- Prefer: "Run validation before deployment to catch configuration errors before they reach the deployed environment."

## 3. Review reference documents before finishing

Check the following and revise any item that fails:

- Can a reader identify the document's purpose without reading the chat?
- Are necessary concepts and prerequisites introduced before they are used?
- Can the reader follow the explanation or procedure using the document and its linked references?
- Does the structure follow the reader's needs rather than the chronology of the conversation?
- Are final decisions, proposals, and unresolved questions clearly distinguished where applicable?
- Have edits been integrated without leaving contradictory or outdated statements?
